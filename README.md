`golicense` is a command-line tool written in Go that makes it easy to add license files to your local projects. It allows you to select from popular open-source licenses and write them directly to your project directory. This tool is designed to streamline the process of managing licenses, making your projects compliant and ready for distribution.

- **Multiple License Options**: Choose from popular licenses such as MIT, Apache-2.0, and more.
- **Automatic License File Creation**: Writes the selected license text to a `LICENSE` file in your project directory.
- **Easy Integration**: Suitable for use in build scripts or automated workflows.

## Installation

```

## Usage

```bash
golicense add --type MIT
